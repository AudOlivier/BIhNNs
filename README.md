# BIhNNs

BIhNNs: Bayesian Inference with (Hamiltonian and other) Neural Networks

* Train neural network architectures like deep neural nets (DNN), Neural ODEs, Hamiltonian neural nets (HNNs), and symplectic neural nets to learn probability distribution spaces.
* Use the trained neural net to perform sampling without requiring gradient information of the target probability density.
* State-of-the-art sampling schemes like Langevin Monte Carlo, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and No-U-Turn Sampling are available for use with the above-mentioned trained neural nets.
